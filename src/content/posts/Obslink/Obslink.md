A few days ago, I came across a post on Xiaohongshu shared by a graduate student from the School of Tourism. The content features food exploration around the Zhuhai Campus of Sun Yat-sen University. Driven by curiosity about delicious food, I decided to build a website dedicated to collecting such food exploration experiences, which is exactly this project:

::github{repo="yuchihatuntun/Tangjia-Bites"}

You can also find its entry via the external links at the top of the blog homepage.
